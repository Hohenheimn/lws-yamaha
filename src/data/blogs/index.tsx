    description:
      "Genichi Kawakami was the President of the Yamaha Corporation from 1950 to 1977, and again from 1980 to 1983.\nIt was from these words in 1953, that today's Yamaha Motor Company was born.\n\n\"I want to carry out trial manufacture of motorcycle engines.\"\n\nBorn in Hamakita, Kawakami was a graduate of Takachiho College of Commerce. He started working for Yamaha in 1937, where his father, Kaichi Kawakami had been the president since 1927. He was looking for a way to make use of idle machining equipment that had previously been used to make aircraft propellers. He explored producing many products, including sewing machines, auto parts, scooters, three-wheeled utility vehicles, and eventually motorcycles which he inevitably focused on. He set the stage for Yamaha Motor Company's success with his vision and philosophy.\n\nThe company built their first motorcycle prototype and later in February 11,1955 the first model, the Yamaha YA1 was completed. It was powered by an air-cooled, 2-stroke, single cylinder 125cc engine. To fully prove that it was up to the task and created in high quality, it was put through a 10,000 km endurance test. This was the beginning of Yamaha Motor's dedication to excellence and surpassing challenges.",
