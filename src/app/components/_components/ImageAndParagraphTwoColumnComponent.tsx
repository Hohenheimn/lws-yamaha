        title={"Assurance and Confidence YZR-M1 is Yamaha Handling"}
        paragraphs={`One big difference between the YZR-M1 and a regular bike is that you only need to use the clutch lever when shifting from neutral into 1st gear. Also, the neutral position is actually no longer usable through the clutch lever as soon as the machine is under power. It only goes back into neutral by pressing a button on the handlebar when you stop the machine. Otherwise, no use of the clutch lever is necessary for upshifting or downshifting. There are some production models now that don’t need the clutch for downshifting, but the YZR-M1 has “seamless” transmission that is highly regarded.\n\n The general notion with the carbon rotors used on the YZR-M1 is that they undergo a rise in temperature once braking force is applied and that gives them sudden and incredible stopping power that can even cause the rear wheel to come off the ground. But in fact, there was no indication of that kind of effect whatsoever. Also, the front fork functions to smoothly release the sudden build-up of internal pressure during braking to ensure the front stays in solid contact with the road. The result is a feeling of incredibly mild but sure footing. When releasing the brakes as well, there’s a smooth feeling without fluctuation from start to finish that makes it very easy to get used to. regardless of when you perform downshifts, the machine maintains the same amount of engine braking; it’s truly a smooth, seamless operation. This means that the rear wheel also maintains contact with the road, so it feels like there’s a good amount of freedom to change the line you run through the corners, even during really hard braking.\n\n As for how the bike leans, it has a compact movement with a low rotational axis, it is also wasn’t excessively sharp by any means. It was light and quick, but also had a softness that made it easy to find a natural rhythm. You can clearly feel the front-end grip. MotoGP machines are not equipped with active suspension that automatically responds to different riding situations like the one on the YZF-R1M. However, when the load forces on the front wheel from braking change into cornering forces at the beginning of a turn, there’s no change in the feeling; the front always feels like it’s being pressed to the road. This is a motion that’s always consistent in the set pattern of going from full-on braking into the lean for the corner. For that reason, you’re not even aware that the rear wheel is maintaining its grip as you make your way through the corner; you just end up leaning into the turn in one smooth motion.\n\n Today’s electronic devices not only have the role of helping a rider recover from mistakes but have also evolved to the point where we are now on the verge of a new era where they constitute an integral package with machines. Even with the latest YZF-R1M, its electronics can detect every direction the chassis moves in as well as the speed of that movement in order to adjust its characteristics and make it easier for the user to ride. That’s how “packaged” these electronic systems have become. But the most important factors are achieving transitional characteristics that are easy for the rider to get used to and making sure that the degree of change in a bike’s character from load forces is not sudden, and so composed and controlled that it’s barely noticeable. This in turn gives the rider the assurance and confidence that allows them to enjoy the ride.\n\n Yamaha’s long-held fixation on handling that gives the rider a sense of assurance, a tradition dating back to the days when most roads in Japan were still unpaved. Yamaha continued to stick stubbornly to this policy of rider assurance. The weight of that history is an invaluable legacy of the Yamaha brand. What’s more, as time passes and those in charge of motorcycle development and evaluation pass the baton to the next generation, the spirit of traditions like this may continue to be handed down, but the realities of how it is practiced may change nonetheless.\n\n What is so surprising about Yamaha Motor, however, is that to my knowledge, the real practices have always continued to hold firm. That’s why, before we knew it, “Yamaha Handling” came to be something we felt or recognized. As I rode the YZR-M1 and was shocked by how easy it was to ride, I knew that its ride would never have been possible without that long Yamaha tradition. It was a test-ride that symbolized the best achievements of Yamaha Handling.\n\n “You can’t enjoy the ride if you don’t feel assurance in the bike’s performance.” This conviction handed down through generations of Yamaha Motor developers and an unchanging dedication to rider-friendly performance always in tune with rider perceptions is what makes Yamaha truly unique.\n\n\n - Ken Nemoto`}
